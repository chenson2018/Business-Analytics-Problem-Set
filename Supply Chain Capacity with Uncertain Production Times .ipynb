In particuliar, 30% of the time step B will be reduced to 50 minutes, while the other 70% of the time step B will remain at 60 minutes. Suppose that we decide to limit our production to exactly 7 units, what can we now say about the time required? Give an exact mathematical formulation"

However, we can see the we could potentially produce an eight unit. If we have had 6 or 7 successes up until this point, we may freely begin another unit. Even if it takes the full 60 minutes, we have already saved enough time to garuentee we will finish this unit on time. Consider the case of five units however, where if we choose to produce an extra unit, we run the risk of the improved process failing...."
